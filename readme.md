# Arduino-Solar-Panel-Cleanser

## Overview & Purpose
This project is an outcome of lack of a proper maintenance system for the solar panels at the roof top of our college campus and one of our 
professors wanted us to develop a mechanism which would resolve this issue. So we've come up with using a pair of motors and a programmed micro controller about which is written below.

## Design
